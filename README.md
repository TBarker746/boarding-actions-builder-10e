Warhammer 40,000 10th Edition: Boarding Actions
==================

## Overview ##

This repository is an in-progress adaptation of the BSData team's 40K Army Builder specifically to handle the Boarding Actions game mode. Ironically, the main builder started work on implementing Boarding Actions itself just as I started working on this, but I've opted to keep this version running too as in my opinion Boarding Actions works sufficiently differently from standard 40K that it's worth having a version of the builder individual to it.

As this repository is an adaptation of another ongoing project, if you want to submit a  [Report a bug][bug report], please check out the [notes page](https://github.com/TBarker746/boarding-actions-BSdata-draft/blob/main/BUGNOTES.md) first, as certain issues should probably be reported on the [original dataset](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-10e/blob/main/README.md) rather than here.
