# boarding-actions-BSdata-draft
An in-progress dataset that adapts the existing 40k Army Builder at https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-10e/blob/main/README.md to write Army Rosters for the rules of the Boarding Actions game mode. Still a WIP at the moment, but Tyranids and Emperor's Children should now be fully up and running.
